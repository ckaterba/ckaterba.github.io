## About 

I'm an assistant professor of math at [Flathead Valley Community College](https://www.fvcc.edu). I primarily teach intro statistics and the courses feeding into this class,but my background is in low-dimensional topology. Back in the day I thought about 3-manifolds and the character varieties thereof. More recently I've been thinking about data science and machine learning, albeit in a somewhat casual way. Below you'll find links to some personal and professional projects I've been working on.
