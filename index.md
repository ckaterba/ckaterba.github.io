## About 

I'm an assistant professor of math at [Flathead Valley Community College](https://www.fvcc.edu). I primarily teach intro statistics and the courses feeding into this class,but my background is in low-dimensional topology. Back in the day I thought about 3-manifolds and the character varieties thereof. More recently I've been thinking about data science and machine learning, albeit in a somewhat casual way. Below you'll find links to some personal and professional projects I've been working on. 

### Teaching resources

- [STAT216](./stat216)

- [M115](./m115)

### Professional things

- Resume

- Old CV

### Projects

#### Data science-y

- NW Montana avalanche forecast generator [very much in progress]

- Montana Scratch Lotto [complete-ish]

- Mortgage as a proportion of income, by county [very much in progress]

- Winter sports heat map

- 

#### Math-y

- [*Ideal points of character varieties, algebraic non-integral representations, and undetected closed essential surfaces in 3-manifolds*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02535). Joint work with Alex Casella and Stephan Tillmann. Link to preprint on the arXiv. 

- [*Modules, fields of definition, and the Culler-Shalen norm*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04585). Link to preprint on the arXiv.

- Twist-knot intersections in the character variety of the Whitehead link. Joint paper with Tim Morris in progress. [Link to some computations in Sage](https://github.com/ckaterba/Twist_Knot_CharVar_Intersection/blob/main/twistIntExploration.ipynb).


#### Goofy

- Naive Wordle solver (in R). 

- [A planet with a moon orbiting a star](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NdGyWh) Simple ray tracing exercise in ShaderToy.
