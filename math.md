## Some math stuff

- [Ideal points of character varieties, algebraic non-integral representations, and undetected closed essential surfaces in 3-manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02535). Link to pre-print of a paper published in the Proceedings of the AMS. Joint work with Alex Casella and Stephan Tillmann.

- [Modules, fields of definition, and the Culler--Shalen norm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04585). Link to pre-print of a paper submitted to Algebraic and Geometric Topology. 

- Twist-knot intersections in the character variety of the Whitehead link. Project in progress with Tim Morris. [Link to some computations in Sage](https://github.com/ckaterba/Twist_Knot_CharVar_Intersection/blob/main/twistIntExploration.ipynb).
