## Personal Projects

Below you'll find links to a few semi-silly personal projects. The less silly a project sounds, the higher probability it has of being incomplete. 

- [NW Montana avalanche forecast generator](https://github.com/ckaterba/FlatheadAvi-Scrape-and-Analyze): Use Flathead Avalanche Center daily forecasts and National Avalanche Center tabular weather station data to train and deploy an ML-generated daily avalanche danger forecast. This might be useful for when the FAC is not providing daily forecasts and when a user is heading out before the FAC publishes its daily report.

- [Montana scratch lotto web-scrape](https://github.com/ckaterba/ScratchLottoScrape): Scrape the Montana state scratch lottery website with R to have STAT216 students calculate the expected value and standard deviation of the winnings for each ticket. 

- [Winter sports heat map](../DDP_projects/DDP_project_1_ski_heatmap.html): A color-coded heatmap of some some winter activities recorded in Strava. The map tile may not have updated

- [Naive Wordle solver](https://github.com/ckaterba/ckaterba.github.io/blob/main/wordle/naiveWordle.R): Created when the game Wordle first started making waves. This solver simply makes a random guess for the first word, trims the dictionary using information from the first guess, then randomly picks another word and repeats until it guesses correctly.
